  ## Description
  Sometimes as a freelance web developer you don't want to a pay graphic designer to create a simple logo for you, so you decide to generate it. The goal is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

  The only requirements are to have the files in your local storage and have the inquirer installed.  

  ## Usage
  - You need to run the code node ./index.js in your console. 
  - Then you'll be prompted for information about your logo.

  This is how the final product should look like.
